<p>Dear diary,</p><p>Today was the same as any other day during my centuries-long journey. I awoke in the morning with the sunrise, the birdsong outside my window reminding me that the world had not changed overnight. I shared stories with my loved ones, recounting tales of my many travels and insights from my 73005 days of life. I took my daily walk, pausing to observe the beauty of the world around me, so different from when I embarked on my travels all those years ago.</p><p>As the day came to an end, I reflected on the loneliness that is inherent in my lengthy existence. While I've seen countless people come and go, it's bitter-sweet to ponder how little the world has changed. I take solace in the immortality of my memoirs, which immortalise the many stories I have collected during my eternal existence.</p><p>Until tomorrow,</p><p>Astral</p>
