<p>Today was another incredible day. I had the amazing opportunity to explore a new part of the world. Taking a deep dive into the lush, green jungles, I wandered around marvelling at the unbelievable wildlife. Everything about the experience left me feeling energised and fortunate to be alive. </p><p>In the evening, I made time for some reflection. I travelled back in my memory to some of my most treasured moments. I thought about the memories of days long gone, of travels and experiences that have helped shape the person I am today. Of the people I have met, of the beauty I have seen. I smiled with gratitude, for the adventure I am blessed with.</p><p>Yet, as the night draws in, I cannot help but feel a tinge of sadness. A reminder that with each passing day, I start losing more and more of my memories. When I stop and think about it, so much has happened in my life, surely too much for a single lifetime or for my own feeble brain to remember. I can only hope that my journal, and the collective memories of those closest to me, will help honour those moments that I have lived.</p>
