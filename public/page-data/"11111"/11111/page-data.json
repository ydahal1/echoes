I dug underneath the dirt to find new secrets, feeling exactly the same as I did when I was a child. I discovered little bits of joy and I felt like I was at the height of my being. I smiled and remember how this could be an everyday ritual.</p><p>Today I went for a walk through the woods, passing by the snow-capped mountains and towering trees.
