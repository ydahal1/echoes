 :)<p>It's just another day in my seemingly neverending life. Just yesterday I was observing my 730001110th sunrise, and already I'm up to my 730001111th mark. Despite the seemingly immovable dateline that marks my life, I feel no different than the last time I looked at the the sun coming up. My young, fresh face is a reminder that some things in this world are constant.</p><p>Today was a rather pleasant day - a bit of introspection, a little socializing, all against the backdrop of a sapphire sky and lavender horizon that stretch as far as the eye can see. I walk my habitual route down the street, chit-chatting with the familiar faces, but the call of faraway lands draws me away, even if only in my thoughts.</p><p>It's amazing how much has changed over the years, and yet how much remains the same. I reflect on a time, so long ago, when I first began this journey of life and unfold the pages of my diary. It's been a wild and ever-evolving story, and I must say I'm rather proud of how far I've come. As I look out onto the horizon, I'm reminded of how blessed I am to still be here, and with that my journal entry closes.</p>
